# Overview

The `partitions` package provides efficient vectorized code to
enumerate solutions to various integer equations.  For example, we
might note that

$$
5 = 4+1 = 3+2 = 3+1+1 = 2+2+1 = 2+1+1+1 = 1+1+1+1+1
$$

and we might want to list all seven in a consistent format (note here
that each sum is written in nonincreasing order, so $3+1$ is
considered to be the same as $1+3$).

# Installation

You can install the released version of wedge from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("partitions")  # uncomment this to install the package
library("partitions")
```

# The `partitions` package in use

To enumerate the partitions of 5:


```{r}
parts(5)
```

(each column is padded with zeros).  Of course, larger integers have
many more partitions and in this case we can use `summary()`:


```{r}
summary(parts(16))
```

Sometimes we want to find the unequal partitions (that is, partitions
without repeats):

```{r}
summary(diffparts(16))
```


## Restricted partitions

Sometimes we have restrictions on the partition.  For example, to
enumerate the partitions of 9 into 5 parts we would use
`restrictedparts()`:

```{r}
summary(restrictedparts(9,5))
```

and if we want the partitions of 9 into parts not exceeding 5 we would
use the conjugate of this:

```{r}
summary(conjugate(restrictedparts(9,5)))
```


## Block parts

Sometimes we have restrictions on each element of a partition and in
this case we would use `blockparts()`:

```{r}
summary(blockparts(1:6,10))
```

which would show all solutions to $\sum_{i=1}^6a_i=9$, $a_i\leq i$.


## Compositions

Above we considered $3+2$ and $2+3$ to be the same partition, but if
these are considered to be distinct, we need the _compositions_, not
partitions:


```{r}
compositions(4)
```

## Set partitions

A set of 4 elements, WLOG $\{1,2,3,4\}$, may be partitioned into
subsets in a number of ways and these are enumerated with the
`setparts()` function:

```{r}
setparts(4)
```

In the above, column `2 3 1 1` would correspond to the set
partition $\{\{3,4\},\{1\},\{2\}\}$.


## Multiset

Knuth deals with multisets (that is, a generalization of the concept
of set, in which elements may appear more than once) and gives an
algorithm for enumerating a multiset.  His simplest example is the
permutations of $\{1,2,2,3\}$:

```{r}
multiset(c(1,2,2,3))
```

It is possible to answer questions such as the permutations of the
word "pepper":

```{r}
library("magrittr")

"pepper"    %>%
strsplit("") %>%
unlist        %>%
match(letters) %>%
multiset        %>%
apply(2,function(x){x %>% `[`(letters,.) %>% paste(collapse="")})
```

## Riffle shuffles

A $(p,q)$ riffle shuffle is an ordering $\sigma$ of integers
$1,2,\ldots,p+q$ such that $1,\ldots p$ and $p+1,\ldots p+q$ appear in
their original order: if $1\leq i_1 < i_2\leq p$, then $\sigma(i_1) <
\sigma(i_2)$, and if $p+1\leq j_1 < j_2\leq p+q$, then $\sigma(j_1) <
\sigma(i_j)$.  The two groups of integers appear in their original
order.  To enumerate all $(p,q)$ riffles, use `riffle()`:

```{r,label=riffleshuffle}
riffle(2,4)
```

To enumerate all riffles with sizes $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_r$, use  `genrif()`:

```{r,label=genrif}
genrif(1:3)
```
